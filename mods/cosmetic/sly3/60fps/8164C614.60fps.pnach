[60 FPS]
comment=Set PAL framerate to 59.94 fps in PCSX2 before using. It's in Properties -> Graphics -> Advanced
// In older PCSX2 versions, it's in PCSX2_vm.ini, make sure to set it to read only.
// On OPL, use GSM and set the game to NTSC. Then use Cheat Device to patch the game
// Note: FMVs are desynced
